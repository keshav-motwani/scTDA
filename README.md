## Applications of topological data analysis to single-cell genomics

This project was done as a final project for MAT4930 Topological Data Analysis taught by Professor Peter Bubenik. 

The goal of this project was to compute persistence homology to single-cell RNA-sequencing samples to be able to detect changes in cell types due to treatment of cells with a drug.
